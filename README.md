# quiz-app
Nonsense In Quiz Form is a quiz app made for Thinkful's interactive web apps module. It's primarily built with JavaScript and jQuery,
with an online-hosted json file to store the quiz app's questions and data. Because of this, the content of the quiz can be swapped out
very easily just by changing the link to the json file, so long as the keys remain the same.
